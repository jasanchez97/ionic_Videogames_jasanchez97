# Videogames App

This page is simply a sample of an effort to achieve the dream of developing a website, with astronomy as a topic that I liked so much as a child.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to have node.js, git and MySQL Worckbench and Server, for a better and faster installation do it in visual studio code.
    https://www.nodejs.tech/es/download
    https://git-scm.com/downloads

    https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/
    https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Create a root user with the name "root" and password "sasa".

    https://code.visualstudio.com/download


Once all these programs have been downloaded, download the repository in the git terminal within Visual Studio with this command:

    git clone https://github.com/jasanchez97/ionic_Videogames_jasanchez97.git

After this, cd backend and install with:

    npm install sequelize mysql2

And on the other side, on the frontend install with:

    npm install ionic@cli

And the last step for the installation, go to MySQL Workbench and create a new schema named db_games.

In case you have all installed and cloned the repository just npm install ngmodules in backend and frontend.

## Deployment

If you don't follow the installation steps it won't work in any way, so it's important that you have followed it step by step.

Open 2 gitbash terminal, one cd backend and the other cd frontend and insert in each one these commands:

    backend: node index.js
---
    frontend: ionic serve

Wait for a moment and It should open the browser with the app showing.
